## Vector向量
 Vectors are one-dimension arrays that can hold numeric data, character data, or logical data. In other words, a vector is a simple tool to store data. 

<font color="green">步驟一<font>
```
# Define the variable vegas
 vegas <- "Go!"
```
步驟二: 輸入c()以建立vector
```
練習輸入
numeric_vector <- c(1, 10, 49)
character_vector <- c("a", "b", "c")

# Complete the code for boolean_vector
  boolean_vector <- c(TRUE, FALSE,TRUE)
得到
# Complete the code for boolean_vector
  boolean_vector <- c(TRUE, FALSE,TRUE)
  numeric_vector <- c(1, 10, 49)
  character_vector <- c("a", "b", "c")
 
# Complete the code for boolean_vector
  boolean_vector <- c(TRUE, FALSE,TRUE)
```

在賭場玩兩種遊戲poker和roulette的輸贏錢狀況
```
poker:
Monday won $140
Tuesday lost $50
Wednesday  won $20
Thursday  lost $120
Friday  won $240

roulette:
Monday  lost $24
Tuesday  lost $50
Wednesday won $100
Thursday lost $350
Friday won $10
```
```
# Poker winnings from Monday to Friday
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
# Roulette winnings from Monday to Friday
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
```
#####Naming a vector!!!
As a data analyst, it is important to have a clear view on the data that you are using.為上述例子的數字命名，使金額可以對應到日期
```
# Assign days as names of poker_vector
names(poker_vector) <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")

# Assign days as names of roulette_vectors
names(roulette_vector) <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
```
```
# Assign the names of the day to roulette_vector and poker_vector
names(poker_vector) <- days_vector  
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector
```
#####計算總合
```
1.
 A_vector <- c(1, 2, 3)
 B_vector <- c(4, 5, 6)
 
 # Take the sum of A_vector and B_vector
 total_vector <- c(1, 2, 3) + c(4, 5, 6)

 # Print out total_vector
 total_vector
[1] 5 7 9
2.
 # Assign to total_daily how much you won/lost on each day
   total_daily <- c(poker_vector)+c(roulette_vector)
3.
 # Total winnings with roulette
 total_roulette <- sum(roulette_vector)
 
 # Total winnings overall
 total_week <- sum(poker_vector)+sum(roulette_vector)
 
 # Print out total_week
   total_week
[1] -84
4. 比較兩種賭法輸贏錢之總合
 # Calculate total gains for poker and roulette
 total_poker <- sum(poker_vector)
 total_roulette <- sum(roulette_vector)
 
 # Check if you realized higher total gains in poker than in roulette
 total_roulette < total_poker
[1] TRUE
```
#####select specific elements of the vector
```
(1) 指定單一
# Define a new variable based on a selection
poker_wednesday <- 20
(2) 指定多個
# Define a new variable based on a selection
poker_midweek <- poker_vector[c(2,3,4)]
---
簡化
c(2, 3, 4)可以被簡化寫成2:4,產生a vector with all natural numbers from 2 up to 4
# Define a new variable based on a selection
roulette_selection_vector <- roulette_vector [2:5]
或是從哪一星期來計算
# Select poker results for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday
poker_start <- poker_vector[c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday")]
# Calculate the average of the elements in poker_start
mean(poker_start)
```
#####Selection by comparison
```
    < for less than
    > for greater than
    <= for less than or equal to
    >= for greater than or equal to
    == for equal to each other
    != not equal to each other
```
```
# Which days did you make money on poker?
  selection_vector <- poker_vector > 0
 
# Print out selection_vector
  selection_vector
結果 Monday   Tuesday Wednesday  Thursday    Friday 
     TRUE     FALSE      TRUE     FALSE      TRUE
```
```
# Which days did you make money on poker?
  selection_vector <- poker_vector > 0
 
# Select from poker_vector these days
 poker_winning_days <- poker_vector[selection_vector]
```
```
進階練習:瞭解另一種方法roulette賺多少
# Poker and roulette winnings from Monday to Friday:
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
days_vector <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
names(poker_vector) <- days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector

# Which days did you make money on roulette?
selection_vector <- roulette_vector > 0

# Select from roulette_vector these days
roulette_winning_days <- roulette_vector[selection_vector]
```
